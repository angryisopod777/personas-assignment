					<p class="card-text">The observations below were gathered from unsuspecting Boba tea shop customers.</p>
					<ul>  
						<li>The Boba serving establishment was packed with groups of stressed out college students and families, and those who chose to order contactlessly chose to in order to avoid longer wait times to order in person.</li>  
						<li>Both new and returning customers were overwhelmed and confused by the number of different drinks, drink categories, and customization options, noting that some drinks appeared in multiple different categories.
						</li> 
						<li> All customers struggled to determine which category their drink was under, and none utilized the search bar.</li> 
						<li>The customization options available were not the same across all drinks, and all customers noted that it was unclear which customization options were required to be selected and which toppings automatically came with each drink.
						</li>  
						<li>New customers wished there were instructions on how to order drinks using the station, and notibly had trouble finding the "add to cart" and "checkout" buttons.</li>
